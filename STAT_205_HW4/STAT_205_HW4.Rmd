### (a) An exploratory data analysis.
```{r}
  FEVdata <- read.table(file="FullFEVdata.txt",header=T, sep="") 
  attach(FEVdata)
  pairs(~Age+Hgt+Male+Smoke+FEV,labels=c("Age","Height","Male","Smoke","FEV"),data=FEVdata)
```
From the figure above, we can see that Age and Height are postively correlated and FEV increases as either of them increase. Smoke-adolescents in this study range from 7 to 18 years old, and have higher FEV.

```{r}
  Age.st=standardize(Age)
  Hgt.st=standardize(Hgt)
  FEV.st=standardize(FEV)
  X.mat=model.matrix(~ as.factor(Male) + as.factor(Smoke) + Age.st + Hgt.st + as.factor(Smoke)*Age.st + Age.st * Hgt.st)
```
